# <center> Is "The Empire Strikes Back" the Fan Favorite Star Wars Film?<center>

## <center> Introduction <center>
    
The purpose of this study is to ascertain if the fifth movie is the most beloved entry in the franchise amongst fans. FiveThirtyEight created a survey to address this question and provided this [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey). In addition to answering this question, perspectives such as gender, fandom, and wage class will be used to show how movie ratings and viewership vary by group.
    

## <center> Summary of Results <center>

Many meaningful findings came from conducting the study. The first item to discuss is the most popular film in the hexalogy. For this table and the following ones, the column labels indicate the group of study, and the rankings of the movies are the row values while the movies themselves are the row labels. For example, A New Hope (IV) is third place in overall rating amongst all respondents and fourth place in terms of viewership.
    
| Motion Picture              | Overall Ranking | Overall Viewership |
|-----------------------------|-----|-----|
| The Phantom Menace (I)      | 4   | 3   |
| Attack of the Clones (II)   | 5   | 5   |
| Revenge of the Sith (III)   | 6   | 6   |
| A New Hope (IV)             | 3   | 4   |
| The Empire Strikes Back (V) | 1   | 1   |
| Return of the Jedi (VI)     | 2   | 2   |
    

The fifth title is the best rated movie amongst the respondents and all the subgroups, as well as the sequel trilogy over the prequel trilogy. However, viewership revealed that the fourth flick had less viewership than the first one. A possible theory could be that the franchise was simply newer and less established as the fourth film was the very first entry to air (1977), while the first prequel film premiered 22 years later (1999). 
    
For the following tables, the viewership element will be omitted because they produced the least relevant results and often mirror the ranking data. Nevertheless, their findings will be quickly summarized in the following points. 
    
1) There were moderately more males than females.

2) The amount of Star Trek fans and non-fans were similar, but the amount of Star Wars fans vastly outnumbered the non-fans. 
    
3) Most participants were in the "50K-99K" wage bracket, although an even larger number chose not to disclose this information.
      
The next table focuses on the rankings of the films by subgroups.
    
| Motion Picture              | Male | Female | Star Wars Fans | Star Wars Non-Fans | Star Trek Fans | Star Trek Non-Fans |
|-----------------------------|------|--------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| The Phantom Menace (I)      | 4    | 3      | 4              | 2                  | 4              | 4                  |
| Attack of the Clones (II)   | 5    | 5      | 5              | 4                  | 5              | 5                  |
| Revenge of the Sith (III)   | 6    | 6      | 6              | 6                  | 6              | 6                  |
| A New Hope (IV)             | 2    | 4      | 3              | 5                  | 3              | 3                  |
| The Empire Strikes Back (V) | 1    | 1      | 1              | 1                  | 1              | 1                  |
| Return of the Jedi (VI)     | 3    | 2      | 2              | 3                  | 2              | 2                  |
    
A few notable details from these subgroups stand out. First, all groups gravitated to the fifth motion picture the most. Second, females were more receptive to the prequels, except the third entry, in comparison to their male counterparts (see Gender graph). Third, non-fans of the franchise were also kinder to the prequels in comparison to the fans themselves; they also rated the prequels almost equally to the sequels (see Star Wars fan/non-fan graph). Fourth, Star Trek fan and non-fan rankings were identical in placement and close to the same in average ranking. In other words, they had the overall, same opinion of the ratings. However, many non-fans of the Star Trek franchise were identified in the dataset (see Star Trek graph), which makes one wonder why the majority of respondents are Star Wars fans, yet the majority aren't Star Trek fans (both are impactful space series).
    
    
    
    
| Motion Picture              | 0-24K | 25K-49K | 50K-99K | 100K-149K | 150K+ |
|-----------------------------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| The Phantom Menace (I)      | 4     | 4       | 4       | 4         | 4     |
| Attack of the Clones (II)   | 5     | 5       | 5       | 5         | 5     |
| Revenge of the Sith (III)   | 6     | 6       | 6       | 6         | 6     |
| A New Hope (IV)             | 2     | 3       | 2       | 3         | 2     |
| The Empire Strikes Back (V) | 1     | 1       | 1       | 1         | 1     |
| Return of the Jedi (VI)     | 3     | 2       | 3       | 2         | 3     |
    
Lastly, the wage groups exhibited virtually unified behavior when compared against the overall results for all respondents. In contrast, what is interesting about them is how the "0-24K","50K-99K" and "150K+" rated the fourth film better than the sixth. With this last table displayed, the last of the most relevant findings has been shown, and the study has been concluded. Thank you for reading.
